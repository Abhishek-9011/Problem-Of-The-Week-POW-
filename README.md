# 💻 Problem of the Week (POW) – Coding Challenge Repository

Welcome to my **Problem of the Week** repository!  
This repository is created as part of the weekly coding challenge initiative launched for BTech CSE Cluster-1 students (2nd Year, Session 2024–25) to enhance consistency, logic building, and interview-style DSA preparation.

## 🚀 About the Challenge

“Writing code is easy. Writing efficient code? That’s what separates good programmers from great ones.”

Each week, we receive 2–3 coding problems designed to:

- Sharpen core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** knowledge
- Improve **problem-solving** under time pressure
- Practice writing **efficient and optimized code**
- Simulate **real interview-style challenges**

---

## 🛠 Repository Structure

For every problem, you will find:

- ✅ **Multiple solution approaches** (wherever applicable)
- 🧠 **Explanations** and **logic breakdown**
- ⏱️ **Time and space complexity analysis**
- 📝 A dedicated `README.md` for each problem

### 📁 Example Structure

├── problem-1/
│ ├── solution1.cpp
│ ├── solution2.py
│ └── README.md
├── problem-2/
│ ├── solution.java
│ └── README.md

Each problem folder contains:

- One or more solutions in different languages.
- A clear explanation of the logic and complexity in `README.md`.
